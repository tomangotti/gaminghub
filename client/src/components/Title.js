            <p>My name is Thomas Angotti, and this is my capstone project at Flatiron. On this website, you’ll be able to create an account/login and user profile. You’ll also be able to chat with other users using Websockets/ActionCable (local only at the moment). You’ll also be able to share Pygames you’ve made and have hosted on other sites, as well as have your Github link to share how you built your game. You can also play other users’ Pygames and then leave a review on those games.
            </p>
